# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recogniser

RTFER uses Convolution Neural Network which is implemented in keras python deep neural networks library. This model is trained on fer2013 dataset and takes camera video input and detcts face usng opencv face detection algorithm and gives the face image input to the pretrained cnn model for predicting the emotion of the face and displays the respective emoji in the place of face on the video.
