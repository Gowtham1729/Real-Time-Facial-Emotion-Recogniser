# Real-Time-Facial-Emotion-Recogniser

RTFER uses Convolution Neural Network which is implemented in keras python deep neural networks library. This model is trained on fer2013 dataset and takes camera video input and detects the face using OpenCV face detection algorithm and gives the face image input to the trained CNN model for predicting the emotion of the face and displays the respective emoji in the place of the face on the live video.
